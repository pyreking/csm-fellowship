## CSM Undergraduate Research Fellowship

This repository documents the research work that I did for my CSM Undergraduate Research Fellowship. The goal of this project was to improve the performance of [Faial](https://gitlab.com/umb-svl/faial) by optimizing [Z3 logic selection](https://microsoft.github.io/z3guide/docs/logic/intro/).

## User Manual

1. Install Faial from the [project repositority](https://gitlab.com/umb-svl/faial).
2. Open a console window.
3. run ``git clone https://github.com/pyreking/csm-fellowship.git`` to clone this repository.
4. run ``cd csm-fellowship`` to go to the project directory.
5. run ``python src/run.py`` to benchmark Faial using different Z3 logics.
6. Edit ``plot.py`` to call ``plot_file_id_and_elapsed_time()``, ``plot_mean_median_std()``, ``plot_status()``, or ``plot_consistency()``.
7. run ``python src/plot.py`` to view the graph.
